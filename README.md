So, apparently, with [alice-tools](https://github.com/nunuhara/alice-tools) it's _very_ easy to edit the text in the game to translate it.

And, as we all know, nowadays ChatGPT is a thing so it should be rather easy to translate the game with rather fine quality.

I'll put here the scripts and their output, hopefully eventually this project will result in a patch that anyone can run to translate the game to English.

Btw, here is the link to the game:
